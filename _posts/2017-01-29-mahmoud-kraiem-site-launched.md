Finally got around to putting this old website together! 
For a newbie (relatively) like myself, it was terrifying. I kept going rounds delaying this in order to learn more before getting to it. I have to admit I have this obcession of not doing things the easy way unless I'd be knowing how it's actually working. Well, I finally decided to do without that at this. Let's learn as we go shall we! 
So I started with a tutorial by JONAHAN MCGLONE (http://jmcglone.com/). It's very simple and easy to follow and it doesn't require much prior knowloedge of Git or Jekyll. Try it out!
This space will host information about me and where I'd occasionly write blog posts.
Please do make suggesting on how I could make it better!
