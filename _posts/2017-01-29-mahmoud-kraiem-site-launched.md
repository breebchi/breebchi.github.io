Finally got around to putting this tiny website together!
At first the idea was to dive in for the learning experience. But It's actually become more of a necessity since I'm currently actively on the look for job opportunities and this ought to help in that matter.
I had previously worked on various web projects, but it was teams were I only had to work on a part of the thing. So for a newbie (relatively) like myself, it was terrifying. I kept going rounds delaying this in order to learn more before getting to it. I have to admit I have this obcession of not doing things the easy way unless I'd be knowing how it's actually working. 
Well, I finally decided to do without that at this. Let's learn as we go shall we! 
So I started with a tutorial by JONAHAN MCGLONE (http://jmcglone.com/). It's very simple and easy to follow and it doesn't require much prior knowloedge of Git or Jekyll. Try it out!
This space will host information about me and where I'd occasionly write blog posts.
Please do make suggesting on how I could make it better!
Oh, and feel free to use any of my code snippets.
