Finally got around to putting this tiny website together!<br>
At first the idea was to dive in for the learning experience. But It's actually become more of a necessity since I'm currently actively on the look for job opportunities and this ought to help in that matter.<br>
For the last year, I have worked on various web projects within teams were I only had to work on a part of the thing. So for a newcomer like myself, it was terrifying. <br>
I kept going rounds delaying this in order to learn more before getting to it. I have to admit I have this habit of not doing things the easy way unless I'd be knowing how it's actually working. <br>
Well, I finally decided to do without that at this. Let's learn as we go shall we! <br>
I started with a tutorial by JONAHAN MCGLONE. It's very simple and easy to follow and it doesn't require much prior knowloedge of <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> or <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. <a href="http://jmcglone.com/">Try it out!</a><br>
Done with the basics, I played with the looks a bit then I jumped to integrating some app examples I had worked on. I will be providing links to these whenever I'm done.<br>
As you'd have guessed, this website will host information about me and where I'd occasionly write blog posts about my work and other more or less random things.<br>
I'm excited about improving this website as much as I can so please do make suggesting on how I could make it better whenever you can!<br>
Also, feel free to use any of my code snippets. I will write blog posts about the context in which each was written and to explain the technical aspects, when it's worth it.
