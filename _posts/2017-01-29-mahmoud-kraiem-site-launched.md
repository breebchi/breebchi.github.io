Finally got around to putting this tiny website together!<br>
At first the idea was to dive in for the learning experience. But It's actually become more of a necessity since I'm currently actively on the look for job opportunities and this ought to help in that matter.<br>
I had previously worked on various web projects, mostly in teams were I only had to work on a part of the thing. So for a newbie (relatively) like myself, it was terrifying. <br>
I kept going rounds delaying this in order to learn more before getting to it. I have to admit I have this obcession of not doing things the easy way unless I'd be knowing how it's actually working. <br>
Well, I finally decided to do without that at this. Let's learn as we go shall we! <br>
I started with a tutorial by JONAHAN MCGLONE (http://jmcglone.com/). It's very simple and easy to follow and it doesn't require much prior knowloedge of Git or Jekyll. Try it out!<br>
Done with the basics, I played with the looks a bit then I jumped to integrating some app examples I had worked on. I will providing links to these whenever I'm done.<br>
As you'd have guessed, this website will host information about me and where I'd occasionly write blog posts about my work and other more or less random things.<br>
I' willing to improve it as much as I can so please do make suggesting on how I could make it better!<br>
Oh, and feel free to use any of my code snippets. I will write blog posts about the context in which each was written and to explain the technical aspects, when it's worth it.
